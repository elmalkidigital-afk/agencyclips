/**
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership security model for the HikmaClips app.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * A user has complete control over their own data, and no access to anyone else's. All data is
 * strictly segregated by user, ensuring privacy and preventing unauthorized access or data leakage
 * between accounts. The default security posture is to deny all access unless explicitly granted.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized hierarchically. A top-level 'users' collection holds individual user
 * profile documents. All user-generated content, such as 'videos', is stored in subcollections
 * directly under that user's document (e.g., /users/{userId}/videos/{videoId}). This structure
 * simplifies security rules by leveraging path-based authorization.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Isolation: Rules are written so a user's operations are confined entirely within their
 *   own data tree (/users/{their_own_userId}/...).
 * - No User Listing: It is not possible to query the top-level '/users' collection, preventing
 *   any potential enumeration of the application's user base.
 * - Ownership Integrity: When new documents are created, rules enforce that any internal
 *   ownership fields (like 'userId' on a video) must match the authenticated user creating it.
 *   These ownership fields are immutable and cannot be changed on update.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The 'Video' documents contain a denormalized 'userId' field. This is a critical design choice
 * that allows security rules to validate video ownership directly from the document's data
 * during writes, without needing a slow and costly `get()` call to the parent user document.
 * This results in simpler, faster, and more secure rules.
